docker-mariadb
==============

Dockerfile for running MariaDB. Based on the `dockerfile/mariadb`, there are some changes like RUnit and a custom DDL initialization.
I think it would be useful for some use cases like installing WordPress, etc.

### Defaults

- Database : maria
- User : maria
- Password : maria
- Remote Access : `allowed for all`
